# Libre Wordpress
The objective of this list is to gather all of [free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and as in free beer plugins for WordPress.

Since WordPress became a popular platform a lot of "free" plugins and themes arrived to the official repository which had their main advertised functionality crippled in favor of a "pro" version. This makes WordPress more hostile for newcomers and even for power users that are looking for a plugin that just works.

Note that not all plugins in the list are completely free, as some may have sane paid versions with features other then the main advertised one. eg: [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/), [The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/).
